# Battle Attack Progress Optimization Summary

## Overview

This optimization implements attack progress reset functionality in the combat system when monsters die awaiting respawn or when switching targets. This improvement enhances combat flow smoothness and logical consistency.

## Problem Statement

The original combat system had the following issues:

1. **Attack progress not reset on target switch**: When a player killed a monster and switched to the next target, the attack progress bar maintained its previous state, potentially allowing immediate attack execution, which wasn't logically sound.

2. **Attack progress not reset during respawn wait**: In continuous or dungeon modes, when all monsters were killed and the system waited for the next wave to spawn, the attack progress bar continued counting, causing new monsters to be attacked immediately upon spawn.

## Solution

### Core Design

Reset the attack track's `NextTriggerAt` property at critical moments and validate whether progress has been reset when attack events execute.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Attack Progress Reset Method

Added `ResetAttackProgress()` private method in `BattleEngine`:

```csharp
private void ResetAttackProgress()
{
    var attackTrack = Context.Tracks.FirstOrDefault(t => t.TrackType == TrackType.Attack);
    if (attackTrack is not null)
    {
        attackTrack.NextTriggerAt = Clock.CurrentTime + attackTrack.CurrentInterval;
        Collector.OnTag("attack_progress_reset", 1);
    }
}
```

#### 2. Reset on Target Switch

Modified `TryRetargetPrimaryIfDead()` to call reset method after successful target switch:

```csharp
private void TryRetargetPrimaryIfDead()
{
    // ... validation logic ...
    
    if (Context.Encounter is null || Context.Encounter.IsDead)
    {
        var next = grp.PrimaryAlive();
        if (next is not null && !next.IsDead)
        {
            Context.RefreshPrimaryEncounter();
            ResetAttackProgress(); // Reset attack progress on target switch
            Collector.OnTag("retarget_primary", 1);
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3. Reset on Respawn Wait

Modified `TryScheduleNextWaveIfCleared()` to call reset method when entering respawn wait state:

```csharp
private void TryScheduleNextWaveIfCleared()
{
    // ... validation logic ...
    
    if (_provider.TryAdvance(out var nextGroup, out var runCompleted) && nextGroup is not null)
    {
        // ... setup respawn ...
        _waitingSpawn = true;
        
        ResetAttackProgress(); // Reset attack progress on respawn wait
        
        // ... logging ...
    }
}
```

#### 4. Attack Event Validation

Modified `AttackTickEvent.Execute()` to add progress reset validation:

```csharp
public void Execute(BattleContext context)
{
    // Check if attack progress was reset (target switch or respawn wait)
    if (Track.NextTriggerAt > ExecuteAt + 1e-9)
    {
        context.Scheduler.Schedule(new AttackTickEvent(Track.NextTriggerAt, Track));
        return;
    }
    
    // ... original attack execution logic ...
}
```

## Modified Files

### Backend (C#)

1. **BlazorIdle.Server/Domain/Combat/Engine/BattleEngine.cs**
   - Added `ResetAttackProgress()` method
   - Modified `TryRetargetPrimaryIfDead()` to call reset
   - Modified `TryScheduleNextWaveIfCleared()` to call reset

2. **BlazorIdle.Server/Domain/Combat/AttackTickEvent.cs**
   - Modified `Execute()` to validate progress reset

### Tests

3. **tests/BlazorIdle.Tests/BattleInfoTransmissionTests.cs**
   - Added `AttackProgress_ResetsOnTargetSwitch_InMultiEnemyBattle()` test
   - Added `AttackProgress_ResetsOnRespawnWait_InContinuousMode()` test

## Test Validation

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Target Switch in Multi-Enemy Battle
**Objective**: Verify attack progress resets correctly when switching targets after killing an enemy.

**Result**: ✅ Passed

#### 2. Respawn Wait in Continuous Mode
**Objective**: Verify attack progress resets correctly during respawn wait in continuous mode.

**Result**: ✅ Passed

### Test Coverage

- All existing tests pass: ✅
- New tests pass: ✅
- Core battle logic tests pass: ✅ (BattleSimulatorTests)
- Battle info transmission tests pass: ✅ (6 tests)

## Code Style Maintenance

This modification strictly follows the existing project code style:

1. **Naming conventions**: PascalCase for private methods, camelCase for parameters
2. **Code structure**: Simple methods with single responsibility, LINQ for collections
3. **Comments**: Chinese comments consistent with existing code

## Performance Impact

Minimal performance impact:

- **CPU overhead**: Negligible (only executes on target switch and respawn wait)
- **Memory overhead**: No new allocations
- **Network overhead**: No change
- **Response time**: No impact

## Backward Compatibility

✅ Fully backward compatible

- Does not affect existing saved battle data
- Does not affect frontend display logic
- Does not break existing API interfaces
- All existing tests continue to pass

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Immediate attack on target switch felt unnatural
- Attack progress bar continued during respawn wait, causing confusion
- New monsters could be attacked immediately upon spawn

### After
- ✅ Attack progress resets on target switch, requiring re-accumulation
- ✅ Attack progress resets during respawn wait, clearer progress bar display
- ✅ Reasonable attack preparation time after new monster spawn
- ✅ Smoother and more predictable combat rhythm

## Key Achievements

- ✅ Implemented attack progress reset on target switch
- ✅ Implemented attack progress reset on respawn wait
- ✅ Added comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Maintained existing code style
- ✅ No performance impact
- ✅ Fully backward compatible
