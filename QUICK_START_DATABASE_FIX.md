# Quick Start: Database Fix Applied ✅

## What Was Fixed?

**Problem**: Database couldn't restart after stopping Visual Studio debugging when battle tasks were configured.

**Solution**: Added automatic WAL checkpoint on shutdown to prevent file locking issues.

## For Developers

### Normal Usage

Just use the application as usual! The fix is automatic:

1. ✅ Start the server: `dotnet run`
2. ✅ Create characters and battle tasks
3. ✅ Stop debugging (Ctrl+C or VS Stop button)
4. ✅ Restart - everything works!

### If You Encounter Issues

**Symptom**: Database locked error on startup

**Quick Fix**:
```bash
cd BlazorIdle.Server
rm gamedata.db-shm gamedata.db-wal  # Remove temporary files
dotnet run                           # Restart
```

### What Changed?

1. **Connection String**: Now uses `Pooling=False;Cache=Shared` for better stability
2. **New Service**: `DatabaseCheckpointService` runs on shutdown to clean up WAL files
3. **Better Logging**: More informative database startup messages

### Files Modified

- `appsettings.json` - Updated connection string
- `Program.cs` - Enhanced error handling and logging
- `DependencyInjection.cs` - Improved connection configuration
- `Services/DatabaseCheckpointService.cs` - New checkpoint service

## Testing

Verified scenarios:
- ✅ Normal startup and shutdown
- ✅ Multiple consecutive restarts
- ✅ Restart after setting up battle tasks
- ✅ Abrupt termination handling

- `DATABASE_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Complete English documentation
- `docs/SQLite数据库WAL模式修复文档.md` - Detailed Chinese documentation
- `docs/数据库重启问题修复总结.md` - Chinese summary

## Technical Details (Optional)

The fix uses SQLite's WAL checkpoint mechanism:
```sql
PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE);
```

This command:
1. Writes all pending changes from WAL to main database
2. Truncates WAL file to zero length
3. Releases all file locks

Executed automatically when the application shuts down gracefully.
