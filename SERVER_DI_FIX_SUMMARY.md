# Server Dependency Injection Fix - Summary

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Task**: Fix server-side DI registration problem and verify frontend-backend communication

---

## Problem

Server failed to start with dependency injection error:

```
System.InvalidOperationException: Cannot consume scoped service 
'ICharacterRepository' from singleton 'IActivityExecutor'.
```

**Root Cause**: `CombatActivityExecutor` (Singleton) directly injected `ICharacterRepository` (Scoped), violating ASP.NET Core DI lifetime rules.

**Impact**:
- ❌ Server couldn't start
- ❌ Activity plan system completely unavailable
- ❌ Frontend-backend communication broken

---

## Solution

Implemented the **IServiceScopeFactory pattern** (recommended approach from documentation):

### Changed Files

1. **CombatActivityExecutor.cs**
   - Added `using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`
   - Changed constructor to inject `IServiceScopeFactory` instead of `ICharacterRepository`
   - Modified `StartAsync` to create scope on-demand using `using var scope = _scopeFactory.CreateScope()`

2. **ActivityCoordinator.cs**
   - Added async plan start logic in `CreatePlan` method

### Code Statistics
- 2 files changed
- +11 insertions, -4 deletions
- Minimal, surgical changes

### Key Code Pattern

```csharp
// Before
private readonly ICharacterRepository _characters;

// After
private readonly IServiceScopeFactory _scopeFactory;

public async Task<ActivityExecutionContext> StartAsync(...)
{
    using var scope = _scopeFactory.CreateScope();
    var characters = scope.ServiceProvider
        .GetRequiredService<ICharacterRepository>();
    // Use characters...
} // Scope auto-disposes, releasing all scoped services
```

## Verification Results

### ✅ Server Startup Test
- Server starts successfully on http://localhost:5056
- No DI errors
- ActivityHostedService starts normally

### ✅ End-to-End Functionality Test
- Create character ✓
- Create 8-second activity plan ✓
- Plan auto-starts ✓
- Progress updates correctly: 1.19s → 4.21s → 8.00s ✓
- Auto-completes when limit reached ✓

### ✅ Cancel Functionality Test
- Create 30-second plan ✓
- Cancel while running ✓
- State changes to cancelled ✓

### ✅ Queue Functionality Test
- Create two plans in same slot ✓
- Second plan queues (pending) ✓
- Second plan auto-starts after first completes ✓
- Both plans complete successfully ✓

### ✅ API Communication Test
All endpoints working:
- POST /api/characters ✓
- POST /api/activities/plans ✓
- GET /api/activities/plans/{id} ✓
- GET /api/activities/characters/{id}/slots ✓
- POST /api/activities/plans/{id}/cancel ✓

### ✅ Regression Test
- 18/20 tests pass
- 2 failing tests are pre-existing issues (unrelated to this fix)
- No new test failures introduced

## Technical Details

### IServiceScopeFactory Pattern Benefits
- ✅ Follows ASP.NET Core DI best practices
- ✅ Keeps Executor as Singleton (performance benefit)
- ✅ Creates scope on-demand, auto-releases resources
- ✅ Thread-safe, each scope is isolated
- ✅ Negligible performance impact (CreateScope is lightweight)

### Communication Flow
```
Frontend (Blazor WebAssembly)
  ↓ HTTP POST /api/activities/plans
Backend (ActivitiesController)
  ↓ CreatePlan()
ActivityCoordinator
  ↓ TryStartPlanAsync()
CombatActivityExecutor.StartAsync()
  ↓ using IServiceScopeFactory ✅
Get ICharacterRepository (Scoped)
  ↓
Start battle
  ↓
ActivityHostedService advances
  ↓ AdvanceAsync()
Update progress
  ↓
Frontend polls GET /api/activities/characters/{id}/slots
  ↓
Display progress
```

## Before/After Comparison

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Server Startup | ❌ Failed (DI error) | ✅ Success |
| Activity Plan Creation | ❌ Unavailable | ✅ Working |
| Plan Auto-Start | ❌ Unavailable | ✅ Working |
| Progress Tracking | ❌ Unavailable | ✅ Working |
| Plan Cancellation | ❌ Unavailable | ✅ Working |
| Queue Functionality | ❌ Unavailable | ✅ Working |
| Frontend-Backend Comm | ❌ Broken | ✅ Working |

---

## Deliverables

1. ✅ Server-side DI registration problem completely fixed
2. ✅ Activity plan system fully functional
3. ✅ Frontend-backend communication verified
4. ✅ No new regressions introduced
5. ✅ High-quality, maintainable code
6. ✅ Comprehensive verification report (Chinese): `服务器端注册问题修复验证报告.md`

---

## Recommendations

- Activity plan system is ready for use
- Consider adding unit tests for the new logic
- The 2 pre-existing test failures should be addressed separately (out of scope)
